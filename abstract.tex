  The aim of this bachelor thesis is to implement the routing of analog circuits to the already existing placer Plantage. Ahead of the actual implementation the placer must be modified to fit the needs of a router. Afterwards the known routing algorithms for analog circuits will be compared and the best fitting solution selected and implemented. For a comparison, the resulting software will be applied to some examples and the results will be discussed.
