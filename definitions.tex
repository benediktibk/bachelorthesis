\chapter{Definitions}

\section{Module}
One module in the terminology of Plantage is just a rectangular shape. From that point of view every circuit element can be viewed as module, transistors, capacitors, and so on. For the placement only width and height of the module is important. The actual dimensions are stored in the variant of the module. Every module can have various different variants, for example with the same electrical behaviour, but different numbers of gates \nref{fig:modules_with_different_gate_number}.

\begin{figure}

	\input{FIG/modules_with_different_gate_number.svg}
	\caption{the same MOSFET with two different numbers of gates}
	\label{fig:modules_with_different_gate_number}
\end{figure}

Also a module typically has some pins, which are named themselves and have a net name, which they belong to. One pin can have some contact areas, but must have at least one. Every contact area is only a rectangular shape, which has a height and width and is positioned relative to the module position.

\section{Group}
In Plantage there are two different types of groups. One type contains only groups and the other one only modules \nref{fig:group_of_modules}. At the moment it is not supported to mix modules and groups in one group. This is important, because slightly different algorithms must be applied for every type of group.

	\caption{groups arrange modules and groups together}
	\label{fig:group_of_modules}
\end{figure}

\section{Shapefunction}
A shape function is basically a list of possible layouts for a given circuit. This list is called shapefunction \nref{fig:shapefunction}, because the minimum possible area for these placements is a hyperbolic function and the placements are located near to this so called pareto front.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=1.8]{FIG/shapefunction.png}
	\caption{shapefunction with possible placements for a miller amplifier}
	\label{fig:shapefunction}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Shape}
A shape is the layout for a certain couple of modules. On the one hand it is used for the layout of the whole circuit, but on the other hand also for the layout of only circuit parts.

\section{Constraints}
In the design of analog circuits a bunch of constraints have to be met. They mainly consider, that certain elements of the circuit should have as similar electrical characteristics as possible. The most prominent example for such a pair of modules are the parts of a differential pair. Differences in these transistors result in a bigger offset of the resulting amplifier, which should be as low as possible.

\subsection{Symmetry Constraint}
Symmetry constraints define a vertical or horizontal symmetry axis for modules. They can contain two different types: Single modules and pair modules. Single modules are placed self symmetric to the axis, pair modules are symmetric pairwise. For the symmetry only the centers of gravity are concerned, therefore pair modules can have different shapes. \nref{fig:constraint_symmetry}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{FIG/constraint_symmetry.svg}
	\caption{horizontal symmetry constraint with one pair of modules and one single module}
	\label{fig:constraint_symmetry}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Alignment Constraint}
An alignment constraint defines a relative position between modules, vertical or horizontal \nref{fig:constraint_alignment}. In the terminology of plantage you always have a A- and B-module. In the case of a horizontal alignment the A-module is placed left of the B-module, in the other case of a vertical alignment the A-module is placed below of the B-module. Additionally it is possible to define a minimum distance between the modules.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{FIG/constraint_alignment.svg}
	\caption{horizontal alignment constraint}
	\label{fig:constraint_alignment}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Group Symmetry Constraint}
The group symmetry constraint is nearly the same like the symmetry constraint. The only difference is, that it can be applied to groups instead of modules. Again we can have single groups, which are self symmetric placed, or pair groups, which are pairwise symmetric to the symmetry axis.

\subsection{Group Alignment Constraint}
Again the group alignment constraint is nearly the same like the alignment constraint with the only difference, that it can be applied to groups.

\subsection{Same Variants Constraint}
The same variants constraint is again very important to for example given differential pairs. To get as far as possible same characterisitics in one placement these modules should have the same variants. They can still have various different variants, but in one certain placement for these modules the same variant is selected.

The implementation of this constraint is based on matching the names of the variants. Therefore it is still possible, that the variants differ, for example the variants for one module are mirrored to the ones of the other part of a pair. This is very useful, as it gives the user a lot more flexibility.

\section{Technology Rules}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{FIG/technology_rule_spacing.svg}
	\caption{minimum spacing rule}
	\label{fig:technology_rule_spacing}
\end{figure}

Typically the manufacturer of the chip provides a so called \textit{tech-file} for the circuit designer, which he can use to create the layout. This information includes for example the minimum distances between two modules. As the knowledge of the manufacturers is very important to them the technology-files are kept secret, and therefore no real standard for them exists. The following descriptions are based on a technology file from Austria Microsystems (AMS), which was available for this project. I assume, that other possible formats can be transformed through the ICFBInterface into something similar. The rules were already extracted through a skill script from cadence, but they were not stored or looped through to plantage. 

The technology rules can have four different types:

\begin{itemize}
\item minimum width
\item minimum spacing
\item minimum notch
\item minimum enclosure
\end{itemize}

The first two rules, considering minimum width and spaces, have one value, the actual minimum width or distance, and the layer, which they should be applied on. The last two types have also a value, but additionally two layers, on which they must be considered. All the rules must be applied to the placement and the routes.

The minimum spacing rule \nref{fig:technology_rule_spacing} is quite easy to understand, it only describes a minimal distance between two shapes on a certain layer. These rules may not be considered if deep trench isolated transistors are concerned, but this doesn't affect the routing. Deep trench isolated transistors result only in a possible bigger, combined, forbidden area for routes.

Minimum widths are very central technology rules for the routing \nref{fig:technology_rule_width}. These values are usually used as width for the routes. Only in special cases, if for example a high current must be transported, the designer may choose a bigger width. The rules can be different for every layer.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{FIG/technology_rule_width.svg}
	\caption{minimum width rule}
	\label{fig:technology_rule_width}
\end{figure}

The minimum enclosure rules describe minimum distances, which need to be met between shapes on different layers. Typically in a technology file there are only minimum enclosure rules, where one of the considered layers is a via layer. A via layer is during manufacturing an additional layer, in which the connections between the different layers are created. For the routing these rules result in the dimensions of the vias on the layers, which they connect.

For some Via-Definitions, for example in the Hit-Kit of AMS, some enclosure rules are missing, at least in the technology file, but for the design rule check these rules are still existing. In these cases I have to assume that there is a certain default value for the minimum enclosure rules: 0.2$\mu$m to the layer below and 0.15$\mu$m to the layer above of a via layer. These values work at least for the technology definition of AMS, but they may differ in the definition of other manucfacturers.

Every via definition must have two minimum enclosure rules, one for every layer, which is connected through the via. Additionally we need one minimum width rule for the via layer, which describes the width of the acutal connection. From these three rules we then can calculate the dimensions of the via, which typically differ for the two layers \nref{fig:technology_rule_via_dimensions}.

\[\text{via dimension} = 2 \cdot \text{minimun enclosure} + \text{minimum via width}\]

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{FIG/technology_rule_via_dimensions.svg}
	\caption{minimum width rule}
	\label{fig:technology_rule_via_dimensions}
\end{figure}

Last but not least there are several minimum notch rule definitions available in the technology definition of AMS. They are mostly used for the internal layout design of for example a transistor. During the routing they define for example a minimum distance between two vias, connected by a route, as this construction forms a notch \nref{fig:technology_rule_notch}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{FIG/technology_rule_notch.svg}
	\caption{minimum notch between two vias}
	\label{fig:technology_rule_notch}
\end{figure}

\section{Electrical Rules}
In the tech-file from the manufacturer there are also electrical rules contained. These rules describe the exact electrical behaviour and can be used for example for the simulation. In the routing algorithms later described I will use these values to optimize the behaviour of the circuit layout, therefore I want to describe how they can be interpreted.

The first important value is the sheet resistance. This value describes the resistance of a layer and I used it to calculate the resistance of the routes. I don't need a really exact resistance, only something to measure and compare which takes into account the different layers. Therefore my personal definition for this algorithm of the sheet resistance will possibly be not the right one, but it is useful in this case. For routes on one layer I just multiply the sheet resistance value with the length of the route, as I always use the minimum width for routes. A via doesn't really have a length, so I multiply the value in this case with the area. Afterwards these two results are  summed up for a whole connection and this represents then the resistance of this connection.

The other two used values are the edge- and areacapacitance. The edgecapacitance describes the capacity between two neighbour routes on the same layer, the areacapacitance the capacity between two routes on the same position but on different layers. The edgecapacity is calculated as product from the length which the routes share as neighbours with the edgecapacitance and the areacapacity as product from the length which routes share as neighbours with the areacapacitance.

All in all the here used definitions are for sure not the right ones, but the results are multiplied with adjustable weights afterwards anyway. Therefore the exact values are not a matter of interest, the results are only used as rough estimations and measurement.
