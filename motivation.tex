\chapter{Motivation}
At the moment a lot of new chips are designed and manufactured, every day. A lot of them are mainly digital, as our modern world becomes more and more digital. But some parts of even those digital chips are still analog, if we want it or not. The problem is, that the sorroundings of a chip will allways be analog, so at least some circuit elements must be viewed as analog. But the analog world still lacks the tools to fully automize the steps from an idea to the actual layout of a chip for manufacturing. There are some tools for placing, and there are some implementations for routing algorithms available. But during the last few years a completeley new approach for the placement was developed and now it is time to implement the next step towards a fully automized analog layout tool into this software: routing.
